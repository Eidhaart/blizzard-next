    "description": "My name is Bartosz Gadziomski. I am an experienced horse rider and champion in dog sled racing. I have over twenty years of experience in stunt coordination for films and live shows, and I currently lead Poland’s top horse stunt team, combining passion, professionalism, and safety in every performance.",

    "title2": "About Me",
    "description2": "My name is Bartosz Gadziomski. I have been involved with horses and dogs since birth. Dogs and horses have always been present in our home. From a young age, I rode horses, and actually, my mother rode while pregnant with me. I just continued the family tradition, and there is much to continue, as one of my great-grandfathers was a lancer, and the other a cavalryman.\n\nMy adventure with dog sledding ran parallel to my work with horses. I had my first start in dog sledding in 1994, and over the years, I have achieved several titles including Polish Champion, Vice World Champion, and European Champion in various disciplines (from 6-dog sleds to canicross). I have competed on tracks across almost all of Europe, as well as in the USA and Canada.\n\nHorses taught me composure, precision, and accuracy, while dog sports gave me self-belief, strength, and resilience. Such extensive experience obliges me to prioritize the well-being of the animals we work with. As a result, they are emotionally connected to us, trust us fully, and become engaged actors rather than mere performers in our shows.\n\nI began my career as a horse stunt performer as a young man with Jacek Kadłubowski's group in Andrzej Wajda’s film Pan Tadeusz. Then in 2000, I traveled with the Malinowscy Trick Riders to the town of High Chaparral in Sweden, where my adventure with horse shows began and continues to this day. I gained experience with the best groups in Poland and abroad.\n\nI have gone through all career levels, from a rider in a theme park to an organizer of historical events and a stunt coordinator for large film productions, both Polish and international. This experience allowed me to create the best horse group in Poland and the best stunt team. Each of us is a specialist in our field, allowing us to complement each other and create fantastic shows and performances, while on film sets, we guarantee the highest professionalism, experience, and safety."

We are a group that not only focuses on the visual effect but also on education. I hope our offer will interest you and that you would like to see us at one of the events you are organizing. We have prepared a special offer: the largest show we have organized so far. A performance with 7 (minimum 5 horses) executed in the style of 17th-century hussars or medieval knights. The program, depending on the size of the area, typically lasts about 45-55 minutes.",
